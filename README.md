# CoreTech Innovations — Frontend (Assignment)

## Project Overview
A responsive, clean multi-page frontend website for **CoreTech Innovations**. Built with HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks) — ready for submission.

## Pages
- `index.html` — Home (hero, services, portfolio highlights)
- `about.html` — About (mission, vision, team)
- `services.html` — Services (detailed)
- `portfolio.html` — Portfolio (projects)
- `contact.html` — Contact (form with mailto fallback)

## How to run locally
1. Clone or download files.
2. Open `index.html` in a browser (works offline).
3. For best behavior test on a small local server: `python -m http.server 8000` and open `http://localhost:8000`.

## Notes
- Replace images in `assets/images/` with real assets if available.
- Contact form uses `mailto:` fallback. Replace with Formspree/EmailJS for a working server-based form.
- Project is fully responsive and accessible.
